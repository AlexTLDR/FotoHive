# Code Organization

- Some codebases are easy to navigate
- Others are hard to follow
- Code organization is often the difference

A good code structure will:

- Make it easier to guess where bugs are
- Make it easier to add new features
- And more

## I am going to use MVC

It isn't perfect, but it:

- Is predictable
- Will provide with some clear rules to follow when organizing code
- It will prevent from getting stuck trying to decide how to organize code
- Is easy to pickup and utilize when learning. (Many others are not and are better suited to experienced developers and teams)

Later I can explore how I might refactor to something different from MVC _when I understand the needs better_
